        "description": "Elsen Tasarkhai is one of the most picturesque places of Mongolia. This 80 km long sand dune is located only 300 km away from Ulaanbaatar. The main road separates the dune into two parts, Mongol Els on the south and Khugnu Tarnyn Els on the north. The sand here is sodden under its surface, so shrubberies such as willow, elm and dogwood, grow in the area. Elsen Tasarkhai lies less than a hundred km away for Kharkhorin, or rather Karakorum, where Chinggis Khaan established a supply base in the mid-13th century. His son Ögedei ordered the construction of a proper capital, a decree that attracted traders, dignitaries and skilled workers from across Asia and even Europe.",
